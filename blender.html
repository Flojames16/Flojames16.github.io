    <h1> Blender Projects </h1>
<h3> <u> 1) Betty </u>  </h3>
   <p> Firstly, here is Betty. She is my pride and joy, the <i> love of my life </i> </p>
    <img src = https://i.postimg.cc/3xsZmkb4/Betty.jpg width = 200/> 
<p> I made her body with the help of a Youtube Tutorial and then I freestyled a beautiful bow on her head. I have never seen anything more perfect. </p>
<p> 11/10 </p>

<h2> <u> 2) Duck </u> </h2>
<p> Say hello to Miss Duck. I never finished her because... Well, I don't know. </p>
<img src = https://i.postimg.cc/76sG1cYs/Duck.jpg width = 200 /> 
<p> I also followed a Youtube tutorial for Miss Duck, but I struggled a lot more with her. I am hoping to fix her at some point in the near future.</p>
<p> 5/10 </p> 

<h2> <u> 3) Ice Cream! </u> </h2>
<p> After a very long break from Blender, I returned to create an ice cream. For this, I followed an excellent Youtube tutorial which really helped. </p>

<p> The ice cream is not perfect by any means. But I like it. </p>
<p> 8/10 </p>

<h2> <u> 4) Low-Poly CAPYBARA </u> </h2>
<p> Currently, I am learning to create low-poly animals. I started with a giraffe (not pictured but I hope to include him soon) before moving on to a capybara. </p>

<p> This capybara was requested by my dear friend Beth. Again, Capy is not perfect but I like it. </p>
<p> 7/10 </p>

<h2> <u> 5) Low-Poly ELEPHANT </u></h2>
<p> I am loving low-poly animals. Here is an elephant: </p>

<p> To be honest, this elephant did not look much like an elephant until it was fixed by my wonderful boyfriend. Thank you Jams. </p>
<p> 10/10 (But only after being fixed)</p>

<h2> <u> 6) Isometric Room </u> </h2>
<p> Here is my current project, an iso-room. </p>
<img src = https://i.postimg.cc/Hs50HYLT/Room.png width = 200 /> 
<p> I love this piece, and I am excited to finish it. </p>
<p> (No rating due to it not being complete yet)</p>
